# PowerApp_Portfolio

## Why did I create this repository?
This repository presents PowerApps that were built to meet a need for management of a large teams time and attendance records. The application uses connectors to display the employees title, as well as photo if a photo is loaded into their Microsoft profile. On app startup, it pulls the employees location coordinates as well as current time. These fields are not able to be edited. The employee can then select if they are clocking in or out, and submit the punch. On the back end, all records are submitted to a sharepoint list. The second application I developed was for the leadership of this team to easily monitor their employees time card. The application allows for choice of date or employee. Once inside of the leader app, the leader can tap on the map button and google maps will open to show the exact location that the employee clocked in or out from.
